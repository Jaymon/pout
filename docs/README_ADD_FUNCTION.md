# Add a function

1. Add an interface class in `pout/interface.py`
2. Import the interface class into `pout/__init__.py`
3. Set a class constant so it can be overridden (eg, `ValueInterface` is set to `V_CLASS` in `pout/__init__.py`)
4. Add your new function using the existing functions as a template (eg, `pout.v`).
5. Add appropriate tests to make sure everything is working as expected
